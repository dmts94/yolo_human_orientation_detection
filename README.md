# yolo_human_orientation_detection

# The goal of this project is to create a bot that will sneak up on people who are not looking at or facing it. 
# The core architecture is based strongly on YOLO v4 and thus relies on the CSPDarknet53 architecture as a feature extraction backbone.

# Resultingly, this also serves to convert that backbone to a keras/tensorflow- friendly interface as it was developed in pytorch.
